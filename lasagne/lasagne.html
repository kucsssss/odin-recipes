<h2>How to make the Lasagne</h2>

    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor. </li>

    <li><strong> Let this simmer </strong>while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>

    <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>

    <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
